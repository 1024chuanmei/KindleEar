    </p>
	<h2>Why am I not receiving push RSS?</h2>
	<p class="answer">For many reasons, the following are a few possibilities:
	<ol>
    <li>didnot enable "Enable deliver custom rss" switch, this switch local in bottom of setting page.</li>
	<li>didnot add kindle email whitelist to your gmail address:</li>
		<ul><li>Solution: add whitelist in http://www.amazon.com/</li></ul>
	<li>the number of custom rss too many to proccess in limit of 10 minutes.
		<ul><li>the number of RSS is generally less than ten, more rss can be supported if have more "fulltext RSS".</li>
		<li>please login <a href="https://appengine.google.com"> appengine </a>, click your application, check if has exception DeadlineExceededError logged in logs, if yes, reduce the number of rss, or split them for two accounts.</li></ul>
	</li>
	<li>the number of rss too many, cause excessive memory of 128MB(default).
	    <ul><li>open <a href="https://appengine.google.com">appengine</a> check if has exception 'soft private memory limit', if yes, click 'Application Settings' in the left, change 'Frontend Instance Class' of section 'Performance' to 'F2(1200MHz,256MB)'.</li></ul>
	</li>
	</ol></p>
	<h2>What is fulltext rss?</h2>
<p class="answer">Fulltext rss is which contains all content of articles in rss, on the other hand, summary rss contains only brief description of articles. you can confirm it by opening the link of rss.</p>
	<h2>Can fulltext rss be processed as summary rss? and vice versa?</h2>
<p class="answer">Fulltext rss can be processed as summary rss, in this case, program ignore the content in rss xml file and fetch fulltext in original link, this would spend much time, resulting in the number of supported RSS decreased. If summary rss processed as fulltext rss, articles pushed to your kindle would have brief description only.</p>
	<h2>How to deal with subscription weekly?</h2>
	<p class="answer">Some rss update weekly, for this type of rss, you can write a py file to directory books of application with variable 'deliver_days' set to a Day like 'Friday'.</p>
    <h2>How Url filter works.</h2>
<p class="answer">Url filter is no for beginner,for whom know Regular Expressions and python. urls in list would not be downloaded for saving of time.</p>
    <h2>How to do if the gfw of China block some rss?</h2>
	<p class="answer">Change the link to use https protocol.</p>
<h2>How to put cover and masthead images in other directory if I add a builtin books.</h2>
	<p class="answer">Put a full path in variable mastheadfile and coverfile, for example:<ul>
	    <li>mastheadfile = 'books/xxxx.gif'</li>
        <li>coverfile = 'books/xxxx.jpg'</li></ul></p>
    <h2>How to deal with when occur SSL error when upload code to gae server?</h2>
<p class="answer">Some fiends in China would encounter urllib2.URLError: &lt;urlopen error [Errno 8] _ssl.c:504: EOF occurred in violation of protocol&gt;, in this case, change the hosts file of OS, add a line "74.125.229.174  appengine.google.com"</p>
    <h2>Some articles garbled?</h2>
    <p class="answer">For custom RSS and built-books without encoding specified, program detects encoding automatically by using chardet module of python, this module is not 100% accurate, and if encoding detected is wrong, the article may be garbled. Because this situation is very rare, KindleEar only supply a not very elegant solution like geeker: manually change chardet-detect encoding saved in database. steps follows:<br /> 
<ol><li>login appid.appspot.com by using account 'admin'(assuming your application name is appid).</li>
<li>input url 'https://appid.appspot.com/dbviewer' in your brower address bar. check encoding of websites in section UrlEncoding. if encoding is wrong for some site, record its ID of database item.</li>
        <li>enter a long string in addressbar of brower, 'https://appid.appspot.com/dbviewer?action=modurlenc&id=dbid&feedenc=fenc&pageenc=penc'
        <ul>before press enter, modify some vaiable follows:
            <li>dbid: the ID of database item.</li>
            <li>fenc: new correct FeedEncoding.</li>
            <li>penc: new correct PageEncoding.</li>
        </ul></li>
    <li>You can obtain the correct encoding by viewing source code of a webpage.</li>
        </ol>
        </p>
    <h2>How can I do if forgot password?</h2>
    <p class="answer">If you have forgotten the password for non-administrator account, you can notify the administrator to change your password. If an administrator password forgot, you can login appengine.google.com, on the left select "Datastore Admin", delete all KeUser data, all account information will be deleted, and then re-use admin/admin login to your application . Did not find "Datastore Admin"? You can active it in the "Application Settings".
        <br />If you know python, you would find other solution.</p>
